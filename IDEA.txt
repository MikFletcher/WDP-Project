a. What problem does your app solve or what purpose does it serve?
    Possible Ideas:
        Dnd note taking app/program?
            -program for players (or dms?) to take notes and section it into areas with charcaters and plot points/etc
        To do app or something

    Dnd Note taking app
        -Created for the purpose of taking notes for a dnd campaign during/after the session. 
        Meant to be an organized and easy way to create notes and reminders for characters, places, plot point etc.

b. Who is the intended user?
    -Intended user is someone who creates or plays in ttrpgs, maybe can be utilized for other
    creative note taking purposeses like for writers. For people who want to organize their notes for ttrpgs/writing


c. What actions will users be able to perform (e.g., sign up, add items, search,
comment, etc.)?
    -Register and account/login
    -Create noytes for a world/campaign, and within that create seperate notes for locations/characters + others
    -Create folders(?) for different sections and have notes within those folders
    -Maybe be able to add images for folders/notes
